Data was scraped from the GitHub API by filtering users in Mumbai with over 50 followers and fetching their most recent repositories.
On average, users with fewer repositories tend to have higher stargazer counts per repository than those with a larger number of repositories, suggesting that focused efforts on fewer projects may attract more attention per project.
Developers aiming to increase their repository popularity should consider focusing on a few high-quality projects rather than spreading efforts across multiple repositories. This can lead to higher average stargazer counts per project, increasing visibility and engagement with each repository.
